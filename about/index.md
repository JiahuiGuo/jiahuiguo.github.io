I am a fifth year Ph.D. student in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science in University of Tennessee, Knoxville,  advised by Professor [Yilu Liu](http://www.eecs.utk.edu/people/faculty/liu). My research focuses on synchrophasor application and data analytics. Before joining UT, I graduated from Tsinghua University with a B.S. in Electrical Engineering in June 2011, advised by Professor [Chongqing Kang](http://www.eea.tsinghua.edu.cn/cn/faculties/cqkang).
